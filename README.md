# Twitter Emotional Words Analysis | Random Sample of Tweets

# Introduction

**As a former Preschool Teacher, part of my ongoing education was to gain more credentials in Early Childhood Education which led me to focus on a key developmental milestone: Social and Emotional Skills.**<br>

 **Learning this subject matter and how to utilize tools for teaching my class was the catalyst for my new found interest and hobby in emotional intelligence and human behavior.** 
 
 **Over a person‚Äôs life, new experiences shape social and emotional skills like a ripple effect in water.** 
 
 **Thus, my curiosity in how Twitter users express themselves on the social media platform.** üí¨<br>
